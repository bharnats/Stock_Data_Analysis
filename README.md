# VBA-stock_data_analysis

Created a VBA script that loops through each year of stock data and grab the total amount of volume each stock had over the year.
Evaluated :
  - Yearly change from what the stock opened the year at to what the closing price was.
  - The percent change from the what it opened the year at to what it closed.
  - The total Volume of the stock
  - Highlighted positive change in green and negative change in red.
  - Made the appropriate adjustments to the script that will allow it to run on every worksheet just by running it once.
  - The script acts the same on each sheet. 
  - Contains screen shot for each year of the results on the Multi Year Stock Data.
  
  The joy of VBA is take the tediousness out of repetitive task and run over and over again with a click of the button.
